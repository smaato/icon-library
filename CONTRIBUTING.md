# Contributing

This project is intended for internal use as Smaato and for sharing some of our
development process with the community, but not for production use by the
public. As such, we would appreciate any Pull Requests regarding bug fixes,
but we won't be able to accept any Pull Requests for additional features or
improvements, since there's no guarantee they'll align with our goals as a
company.
